    > This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed.
    >
    > It prints whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative
    >
    > The variable `n` will store a different value every time the program runs
    > The output of the program is:
    >   - The number followed by
    >       * if the number is greater than 0: `is positive`
    >       * if the number is 0: `is zero`
    >       * if the number is less than 0: `is negative`
    >   - followed by a new line
